<h2>Disigned Web Pages<h2>
<br>
<ul2>
	 <li1><p><b>Robo Diary:</b><br>
	 I used a custom jekyll theme for these web pages, jekyll themes are some awesome tools for web development
	 as it reduces the work on CSS file. Jekyll is an awesome tool for viewing a live website on your local host.
	 Through jekyll modularity can be achieved. You can watch this web page on GitHub, the link is given in the right corner.<br><br> 
	 </p></li1>
	 <li1><p><b>My Portfolio:<b><br>
	 This Portfolio is also made through jekyll, but no theme is used this time.<br><br>
	 </p></li1>
	 <li1><p><b>Back To The Future:<b><br>
	 I have made this static web page for a competition, without any custom theme or using jekyll.
	 It is a picture story teller and is based on the Movie Back To The Future.
	 </p></li1>
